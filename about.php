      <div class="picture"><img src="images/team.jpg" width="535" height="340" alt="team"></div><br>We are a young team of ambitious and creative people who decided to go through life, doing oue favorite things.<br>Our team has a dozen people, most of whom are far from beginners. Some artists already had experience performing with their works in Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic and Belarus. The portfolio of some of the project participants includes  than three dozen paintings that you could see at exhibitions in Kiev, Poltava, Kharkov and Chernigov.<br><br>The age range of our team is wide enough. Experienced artists who have gone through a long career have been constantly instructing newcomers with ambition in their eyes and inclinations for true talent are undeniable.<br>Why don't you make sure of our professionalism and responsibility for this work?<br><br><h2 align="center" style="font-size: 25px;">So why did we decide to give life to this project?</h2><br><br><img src="images/working.jpg" width="535" height="340" alt="working" style="float: right;">

      Gone are the days when only the originals of the paintings hung in the houses, it was time for photo production, new technologies for printing images on all kinds of materials, vinyl stickers and copies of famous paintings.The essence of this project is that any person from anywhere in the world can afford to please himself or his beloved people with a piece of real art. In the current era of technology and the availability of any product, gifts have become terribly boring. If this is not a mug, T-shirt, postcard, then this is the most commonplace money. We offer people a truly original way to bring joy to a person by capturing anything on the canvas. And in particular - his portrait, a picture from a wedding photo, depict pastel kids.Stand out from the gray crowd of banal presentations, giving loved ones a truly unique art.Present a beautifully painted handmade portrait to your girlfriend, boyfriend, wife, husband, parents or children. Leave an imprint of this day in their memory for many years.<br><br><h2 align="center" style="font-size: 25px;">What can we offer for you?</h2><br><br><img src="images/work2.jpg" width="535" height="340" alt="working" style="float: left;">

      Our team is ready to provide only high quality work. <br>Individual orders are available to any person, just make a "click". We treat our work with diligence and responsibility. <br>The idea of the project was born from my personal observations of the joy and smiles of the people to whom I gave portraits. That is why the biggest reward for us is not money, but the joy of the people to whom you made such a beautiful and unique gift.<br>Do you still have thoughts about the present? Thinking whether you should trust us with such an important job? Still not sure how to diversify your interior? So go to the page with examples and finally decide for yourself. Be sure that no one has ever given this before you. If we could not convince you, we wish you good luck in finding a beautiful card or mug.<br><br>
